                Prism agrees to adhere to all applicable United States federal and state laws, statutes, and

                <strong>CHOICE OF LAW</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Virginia,
                United States of America, without regard to conflict of laws provisions. You hereby consent to the
                exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal or state courts in Prince William County, Virginia in all
                disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the Site. Use of the Site is unauthorized in any
                jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms, including without limitation
                this paragraph. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists
                between you and Prism as a result of this agreement or use of the Site. If any part of this agreement
                is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to,
                the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable
                provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the
                intent of the original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall continue in effect. Unless
                otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the user and Prism
                with respect to the Site and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals,
                whether electronic, oral or written, between the user and Prism with respect to the Site. A printed
                version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or
                administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to
                the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in
                printed form.

                <strong>TERMINATION</strong>

                all materials downloaded or otherwise obtained from this Site, as well as all copies of such materials.
